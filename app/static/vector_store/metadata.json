The State also ranked eighth (8th) in the Export Preparedness Index 2022, by contributing to the Top 5 exporter states of India (by value) in terms of export of organic/inorganic chemicals, drugs & Pharmaceutical products. Notably, Andhra Pradesh is the only state with three (3) industrial corridors: Visakhapatnam -Chennai Industrial Corridor (VCIC), Chennai -Bangalore Industrial Corridor (CBIC), and Hyderabad -Bangalore Industrial Corridor (HBIC). 3.2. Overview of the Maritime Sector in Andhra Pradesh Andhra Pradesh State offers tremendous potential for the development and growth of a wide spectrum of maritime activities. The seaports in India account for 95% of the merchandise trade. The state has one major port, Visakhapatnam, and five 5 operational non -major ports namely: Gangavaram, Krishnapatnam, Kakinada Deepwater & Anchorage Ports, Ravva Port (a captive port) - under the jurisdiction of the Andhra Pradesh Maritime Board (APMB). E stablished under the AP Maritime Act of 2019, APMB oversees and manages the state\u2019s maritime assets. AP\u2019s Non -major Ports ranked second (2nd) in EXIM cargo handling during FY23, with 117.62 MMTPA at 66% utilization. APMB is ideating port -led development by establishing four (4) new Greenfield ports at Mulapeta, Kakinada Gateway, Machilipatnam & Ramayapatnam, amongst others, to ensure the comprehensive realization of coastal hinterland potential. Seven other Notified Ports include Meghavaram, Kallingapatnam, Bheemunipatnam, Nakkapalli, Narsapur, Nizampatnam, and Vodarevu. To promote economic growth driven by coastal development and to reinforce Andhra Pradesh's position as a major exporting state, GoAP recognizes the need for world -class maritime infrastructure. Therefore, it has proposed a new maritime development policy t o address this need comprehensively and holistically. 4. Policy Period & Applicability 4.1.

Page | 14 6.2. Ports & Terminal Development The Non -Major Ports (both existing & upcoming) under the GoAP will be offered for commercial development through private participation. A Mega Port will be established under GoAP that will act as a central hub for cargo movement to/from the hinterland and as a major EXIM Trade Centre. All the Notified Non -major Ports of Andhra Pradesh state will be developed based on the state models, this will be promoted to leverage the geographical advantage of being located centrally on the east coast of India and close to the countries in the Bay of Bengal region. The life cycle stages that will be followed for the development of Non -major Port Infrastructure are briefly described as follows: 6.2.1. Licensing of Commercial Ports - Greenfield Licensing of Commercial Ports (especially Greenfield Ports) is broadly segmented into two (2) models. Under these models, ownership of the Port Land & Waterfront allotted to the Concessionaire (Private Developer) will rest with GoAP. The State will license the land to the Concessionaire as per the Land Policy and Guidelines approved by the GoAP. Model 1: Landlord Model for Port Operation & Maintenance i. The development of certain core infrastructure for commercial ports will be under GoAP, the development activity broadly consists of the following items: o Construction of breakwater o Capital dredging of the approach channel o Rail/road connectivity infrastructure ii. Depending on the viability of the project, the GoAP would engage private developers to develop certain ancillary infrastructure such as : o Construction of terminals, berths & jetty, o Construction of warehouses, buildings , and other port -related facilities through Public -Private Partnerships (PPP) Enhancing Cargo Handling Capacity Boosting EXIM trade PORTS & TERMINAL DEVELOPMENT Enabling Ecosystem of Industrial clusters, Logistics centers and Urban Development Attracting private investment & leveraging Public -Private Partnerships PORT PROXIMAL AREA DEVELOPMENT Establish World -class Shipyards and allied facilities Innovation and Technology Adoption Attract investment in Shipbuilding and Ship Repair sector SHIPYARD & CLUSTER DEVELOPMENT Develop navigable waterways to facilitate safe and efficient Inland Water Transport Designing industry -relevant curricula and training programs to equip the workforce skills Investing in research and training initiatives focused on innovative maritime technologies and best practices.

The cost of repair & maintenance and management (O &M) of the Project during the license period will be borne by the Concessionaire (Private Developer) and no liabilities whatsoever will devolve on GoAP at any point in time. Model 2: Public Private Participation (PPP) Model i. Under this model, the GoAP will act as a Conce ssioning Authority and will be providing statutory support in obtaining necessary approval and clearances rather than developing core infrastructure for the port operation. ii. The Concessionaire (Private Developer) would undertake comprehensive development of the port, including both core and ancillary infrastructure as mentioned in Model 1, facilities through relevant Public -Private Partnerships (PPP) models as mentioned in the Policy iii. The construction & upgradation of infrastructure for the ports will be provided by the Concessionaire ( Private Developer) based on the design approved by the GoAP. iv. The cost of construction, repair & maintenance , and management (Operation & Maintenance) of the Project during the license period will be borne by the Concessionaire (Private Developer) and no liabilities whatsoever will devolve on GoAP at any point in time. v. GoAP will make the following necessary provisions: o Ensure national security and public order o Performance evaluation o Audit of cargo traffic and accounts o Development of infrastructure for the benefit of the People of the state such as Ro - Ro/Ro -Pax terminal, Coastal terminal, Cruise terminal, fishing jetties, etc. o Safety -related audits o Improvement of local livelihood through skill development and job creation o Betterment of the Coastal Community The concession period and mode of transfer of assets at the end of the period in both models will be based on the mutually agreed concessionaire agreement based on the PPP model on a project -to- project basis. Framework for Transitioning Port Operations in Andhra Pradesh from Landlord Model to PPP Model: The Government of Andhra Pradesh will conduct a comprehensive assessment of the Landlord ports to identify opportunities for optimizing operational efficiency and infrastructure development. This assessment will explore potential Public -Private Partnership s to leverage private expertise and investment in port operations while maintaining the core responsibilities and oversight under the GoAP's regulatory control. This collaborative effort aims to operate the Port efficiently, improve service delivery, and p romote economic growth in the region. This transition will align with global best practices, the Model Concession Agreement (MCA) 2021 issued by the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways (MoPSW), and insights from the World Bank\u2019s studies on PPP models. This framework will be specific to t he context and needs of Non -major Ports of Andhra Pradesh. 1. Port -Specific PPP Models Building on the in -depth assessments of all ports in Andhra Pradesh, considering factors like existing infrastructure, cargo type, traffic volume, and market potential, the GoAP will adopt Page | 16 tailored PPP models.

Port -Specific PPP Models Building on the in -depth assessments of all ports in Andhra Pradesh, considering factors like existing infrastructure, cargo type, traffic volume, and market potential, the GoAP will adopt Page | 16 tailored PPP models. There are broadly three models that are used for the implementation of Public -Private Partnership projects which are as follows: \u25cb BOT (Build -Operate -Transfer): For ports requiring significant infrastructure development, encouraging private investment in terminal construction and operations. \u25cb OMT (Operate -Maintain -Transfer): For existing ports with well -developed infrastructure, leveraging private expertise for maintaining and enhancing facilities. \u25cb Lease Model : For smaller ports or specific terminals, allocating operations to private entities through structured lease agreements with clear performance benchmarks. 2. Financial Framework and Revenue Sharing \u25cf Dynamic Revenue -Sharing Models: Implement throughput -based royalty payments or gross revenue -sharing agreements that align public revenue with port performance, ensuring both the public and private sectors benefit from increased efficiency and traffic. \u25cf Minimum Revenue Guarantees: Incorporate minimum guarantees to safeguard the state\u2019s financial interests during periods of demand volatility, providing a safety net for public revenue. \u25cf Financial Modelling and Viability: Conduct thorough financial modeling for each PPP project to assess the long -term viability of different models and revenue -sharing mechanisms. This will include sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of various factors on project profitability and st ate revenue. 3. Risk Allocation \u25cf Demand Risk: Primarily allocated to Concessionaires (Private Developers), as they are better equipped to drive traffic and manage market uncertainties. \u25cf Operational Risk: Responsibility for efficient maintenance, staffing, and technological upgrades rests with private entities. \u25cf Regulatory and Sovereign Risk: The GoAP (public sector) ensures policy stability, transparent governance, and effective dispute resolution mechanisms to protect private investments. \u25cf Dispute Resolution: Establish clear and efficient dispute resolution mechanisms, such as arbitration or mediation, to address potential conflicts between the GoAP and Concessionaire (Private Developer). 4. Performance Monitoring and Accountability \u25cf Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Establish robust KPIs, including cargo handling efficiency, turnaround times, environmental impact metrics, and safety records. These KPIs will be linked to Concessionaire (Private Developer) incentives and penalties. \u25cf Independent Oversight: A dedicated port regulatory authority will oversee compliance with concession agreements, ensure adherence to KPIs and international benchmarks, and promote transparency and accountability. \u25cf Technology Integration: Encourage the adoption of modern technologies, such as digital platforms for cargo tracking, port management systems, and automation technologies, to enhance efficiency and competitiveness.

However, assistance for the same may be provided by the GoAP. \u25cf Road linkage project\u2019s expenditure can be recovered by private players through the levying of tolls on port traffic. The local traffic will be exempted from toll charges as a social responsibility. 2. Rail Connectivity Rail linkage projects for ports may be structured on a joint venture or non -government railway model as per Policy No. 2011/infra/12/32 issued by the Ministry of Railways. Any new amendments or policies replacing the existing policy issued by the Ministry of Railways will apply. The policy provides participative models for rail connectivity and capacity augmentation. The State government and/or any other government entity may also participate in the equity investments in both non -government and joint ventur e models. Institutional Mechanism: To enhance port and maritime growth in Andhra Pradesh, developing connectivity infrastructure and expanding road and rail capacities are critical. Hence, to synchronize the development of road Page | 21 and rail infrastructure connectivity to the ports in Andhra Pradesh, APMB will coordinate with stakeholder agencies through the Planning and Monitoring Wing under SMWTC. Fiscal Incentives: Under APMP 2024; eligible projects within the PPA will be incentivized based on the Fixed Capital Investment (FCI) range, categorized as Sub -large, Large, Mega, and Ultra Mega for providing the relevant incentives as per the Andhra Pradesh State Industrial Policy (4.0) 2024 - 2029 (outlined in Chapter 8) or as per the relevant amendments to the State industrial policy from time to time ensuring a consistent framework for investment support across sectors. 6.4. Shipyard & Cluster Development Objective: Based on the present shipbuilding ecosystem and the vision to develop a holistic Andhra Pradesh Maritime ecosystem, GoAP will plan to develop shipbuilding and ship repairing yards along with necessary ancillary facilities under APMP - 2024. GoAP has adopted a cluster -based approach to developing shipbuilding and ship -repairing industries in collaboration with APMB & APIIC. APMP - 2024 aims to foster sustainable growth and economic development in Andhra Pradesh by enhancing the shipbuilding and ship repair ind ustries through the following objectives: o To grow AP\u2019s share in the national target of the sector to 25% by 2047. o To explore potential & resources available and to attract investment for the shipbuilding & ship repair sector. o To establish world -class shipyards and repair facilities. o To ensure sustainable and environmentally compliant"}, "1_506789a99681479bbd24d4b6de1e0ff6_14": {"doc_id": 1, "chunk_index": 14, "chunk_text": "Pradesh by enhancing the shipbuilding and ship repair ind ustries through the following objectives: o To grow AP\u2019s share in the national target of the sector to 25% by 2047. o To explore potential & resources available and to attract investment for the shipbuilding & ship repair sector. o To establish world -class shipyards and repair facilities. o To ensure sustainable and environmentally compliant shipbuilding practices. o Boost the overall socio -economic development of the coastal region. o To support ancillary industries and create employment opportunities. o To explore opportunities to attract Defense shipbuilding and shipyards to the state of Andhra Pradesh through appropriate collaboration. Development of shipyard for shipbuilding and ship repairing are based on the broadly segmented three (3) models: Model 1 : Shipyard development at Landlord ports i. This model will be applied to the Greenfield ports such as Ramayapatnam, Machilipatnam, and Mulapeta which are under construction, and any other greenfield ports developed in the future. ii. The development of shipyard projects will be undertaken by the Concessionaire (Private Developer) through a long -term lease or mutually agreed concession agreement based on the relevant Public -Private Partnerships (PPP) models as mentioned in the Policy. iii. This model will encourage private entities to invest in and develop the shipyards, ensuring the necessary infrastructure is built to support maritime activities. Model 2 : Shipyard development at Private Ports i. This model will apply to existing brownfield operational ports under APMB such as: o Gangavaram o Kakinada Anchorage o Kakinada Deep Water Page | 22 o Rawa o Krishnapatnam ii. Under this model the Concessionaire (Private Developer) will have the flexibility to develop shipyards either independently or in partnership with other entities (through sub -licensing), this involves promoting private sector involvement in enhancing port infrastructure. iii. Responsibility to provide infrastructure facilities and access linkages will be of the Concessionaire (Private Developer) and/or Shipyard Company. Model 3 : Standalone Shipyard Development i. This model will be applicable to the development of a standalone shipyard for shipbuilding and ship repairing. ii. This model emphasizes the need for conducting techno -economic feasibility studies and creating a detailed development plan (Master Plan) for the establishment of standalone shipyards in exceptional cases where marine parameters, environmental conditions, a nd land availability are suitable. Best Practices to be adopted for the establishment of Shipbuilding & Ship Repair yards in Andhra Pradesh State: \u25cf Develop Specialized Facilities: Focus on specific vessel types (e.g., cargo ships, passenger vessels). \u25cf Establish Integrated Clusters: Clusters that include ship repair facilities, spare parts manufacturing, equipment suppliers, and testing facilities. \u25cf Build strong supply chain networks to reduce dependency on imports. \u25cf Create Maritime Skill Development Centers: Offer specialized training programs in modern technologies and automation systems.

These enterprises are crucial for fostering industrialization, driving innovation, and creating employment opportunities, thus playing a pivotal role in ensuring India\u2019s economic stability. Officially defined by the Government of India, effective from July 1, 2020, MSMEs encompass businesses from both manufacturing and service sectors. The classification relies on two primary composite criteria\u2014investment in plant and machinery or equipment, and annual turnover. In the Union Budget 2024-25, the Government of India announced significant revisions to the MSME classification criteria. Specifically, the investment limits have been increased by 2.5 times, and turnover limits have been doubled. These changes aim to enable MSMEs to scale operations without losing essential benefits and incentives, thus promoting broader economic growth and employment generation. Here is a quick overview of the revised MSME criteria as per the Union Budget 2024-25: Enterprise CategoryPrevious Investment LimitRevised Investment LimitPrevious Turnover LimitRevised Turnover Limit Micro Enterprise\u20b91 crore \u20b92.5 crore \u20b95 crore \u20b910 crore Small Enterprise\u20b910 crore \u20b925 crore \u20b950 crore \u20b9100 crore Medium Enterprise\u20b950 crore \u20b9125 crore \u20b9250 crore \u20b9500 crore Access to Govt Schemes Reduces financial burden with favorable ratesBenefits of Udyam RegistrationLower Interest Rates Opens doors to government support and opportunitiesFacilitates smooth operations across platformsEnsures timely payments and financial stability Extended MAT Credit Offers tax benefits for businessesPriority Sector Lending Provides preferential financial supportProtection against Delayed PaymentsSeamless Integration12The Udyam Certificate is an essential document for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in India, issued by the Ministry of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MoMSME).

This Ministry had facilitated several meetings of the SIP Evaluation Committee - a Committee constituted with the approval of the Competent Authority in the Ministry, comprising of officials from other Ministries, academia, and industry experts - to evaluate the SIPs and recommend projects/ proposals for part-funding from the RAMP programme, as per the scheme guidelines. After many brain storming sessions, and based on the collective w'isdom of its Members, the SIPEC evaluated and recommended some projects and the quantum of financing under RAMP. The SIPEC, in conformity with the RAMP implementation guidelines, recommended benchmarking the cost of common activities proposed by all States such as Awareness Programmes, Vendor Development Programmes, EDP/Skill Development Programmes, training for MSME Champions schemes and training of State Govt. Industries/ MSME Department officials. 3. The RAMP Programme Committee (RPC), the apex body headed by Secretary(MoMSME) mandated to steer and guide the implementation of RAMP prograrnme, in its meeting dated lOth November, approved the recommendations of the SIPEC, including the quantum of funding. I may also add ttrat, in its 4th meeting held on 02\"d August 2023, the RPC had recommended that to incentivize the States that honoured the first deadline for submission of SIPs 9 15th August 20231, 600/o of the total funds available for SIP financing may be earmarked for these States. The RPC, in its 5m meeting, approved 67%. 4. The list of selected project proposals received from Andhra Pradesh State, along with the quantum of funding recommended, is annexed. The RPC also recommended that 50% of the total amount approved for part-financing of selected project proposals be provided in the frrst instalment, to the States. However, due to paucity of funds this frnancial year, an amount equivalent to 4Oo/o of the tota-l approved project cost is being provided (4O% of total cost of approved amount Rs. 1O7.07 Crore). The State of Andhra Pradesh is therefore being provided a grant of Rs. 42.83 Crore as a first instalment. 5. The subsequent tranches of Grant-in-Aid will be released only after 75% of the first tranche is utilized and at least 50% of the targets for that project are achieved. 1 Room No. 49, Udyog Bhar,van, New DelhFll0008 Tel. : +91-11-23062081, E-mail :js.afiflsmo@gov.in, Wobsite: wu,w.msme.gov.incrfi?r Eqr< R{E qigm qfrq ATEESH KUMAR SINGH Joint Secrelary 6.

Hence they were not considered for separate funding from the RAMP Budget. In view of the overlap, these proposals have not been considered for part funding under RAMP. 7 . IErC: Keeping in view the importance of branding, awareness and communication, an amount of 5o/o of the overall approved support from the RAMP budget forthat State, has been allocated.States are required to take the approval of the Mlnistry of MSME before launching auy branding campalgn. 8. SPIU: Rs 5 Cr has already been disbursed to the States / UTs towards SIP preparation.
